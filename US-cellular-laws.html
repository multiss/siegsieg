<b>Florida</b>
<br>
Cell phone use is allowed as long as sound is provided in one ear and the surrounding sound can be heard through the other ear. Using a cell phone headset like a Bluetooth headset that wraps around one ear fits the legal requirements of this law.

Florida also has preemption laws that prevent local jurisdictions from further restricting cell phone use in cars.

<br><br><br><br /><br /><b>Proposed Laws</b>
<br><br>Although currently, we have limited laws in effect regulating cell phone use in cars, this may not be the case after this years legislatures meet. The following information was found on the National Conference of State Legislatures website. There, they maintain a state legislation database on driver focus and technology. Thirty eight states currently have bills which are actively being pushed through their legislatures. These bills include language such as: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Drivers under a set age (usually 21, 18, 17, etc.) or with a learners permit may not use a cell phone while driving a car. This includes the use of cell phones with hands-free technology such as an installed car-kit or a wireless headset. In this case, when shopping for a car, you might still want to get a car-kit for your cell phone since the prohibition will be removed once the driver reaches a certain age or gets a regular license. 
<li>Prohibits the use of hand-held phones while driving (mostly in motor vehicles but at least one states laws mentions motorcycles), except for the case of an emergency. In this case, you can use a cell phone with hands-free accessories such as a cell phone headset or a cell phone car-kit that keeps your hands free while driving. 
<li>Prohibits the use of cell phones while driving, without any latitude for hands-free use with cell phone accessories such as cell phone headsets or cell phone car kits. 
<li>Prohibits dialing a cell phone while driving. In this case, besides a hands-free accessory such as a headset or having a car-kit, you'll need a cell phone that supports voice activation. 
<li>Prohibits the use of a cell phone in a school zone. 
<li>Prohibits the use of cell phones and headsets that cover both ears while driving or bicycling. In this case you can use a headset, but you're going to need one that doesnt cover both ears. There are a number of Bluetooth headsets which wrap over just one ear which would fit the legal requirements for this law. 
<li>Prohibits certain types of drivers from using cell phones: school bus drivers, large truck drivers, taxi car drivers. In this case, having cell phone accessories like a car-kit or a headset in the vehicle wont let you legally make cell phone calls while the vehicle is in motion. 
</ul>
